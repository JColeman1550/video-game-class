## Description

This project is a simple JavaScript class called fightingGames that models various fighting games. 
It includes properties such as the game's name, release year, production studio, and main protagonist. 
The class also has methods to display information about the game, including when it was released, who produced it, and the main character.


## What I Learned
Through this project, I learned how to create and utilize classes in JavaScript, 
including how to define properties and methods, and how to instantiate objects from a class.
